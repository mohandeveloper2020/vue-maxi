Vue cli setup steps
-------------------

sudo npm install -g vue-cli

vue init webpack-simple my-project

cd my-project

npm install

npm run dev


It provides the my-project folder with initial setup of vue with webpack and package.json files
and can be accessed at http://localhost:8081/


--------------------------

Just to have initial setup files for understanding, I create a new project folder with name project-1
with same setup steps

vue init webpack-simple project-1
cd project-1
npm install
npm run dev

can be accessed at http://localhost:8082/
